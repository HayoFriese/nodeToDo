			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>This is a templating engine to set up a component-based Express server. This can be expanded to fit certain stacks in the future (such as MEAN or MERN, or MEVN, is it called that?).</p>
			<p>Should you wish to make use of this template, please post the following line of code in your HTML:</p>
